The Project Centric Mailbox is a new way to think about emails. 

It gathers in a single screen 5 kind of data (emails, documents, calendar, contacts, task list) which had been splitted in different tools before. The Project Centric Mailbox allows its users to keep the data-cohesion coming out from their natural workflow. 

As such, the mails generally tend to be on of the mandatory exchange process of information, 
having a real high data-cohesion (contact, document, tasks appointment, meeting schedulings, conversations). 

We try to keep this data-density into a unified interface : the Project Centric Mailbox.
